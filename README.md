README for mpdevil
==================
Mpdevil is a simple music browser for the Music Player Daemon (MPD) which is focused on playing local music without the need of managing playlists. Instead of maintaining a client side database of your music library, mpdevil loads all tags and covers on demand. So you'll never see any outdated information in the browser. Mpdevil strongly relies on tags.
